U.A.E Universal Amiga Emulator

This is based off 0.8.29 and is targetted for SDL/ARM/UNIX so it can run on the Blackberry phones and tablets.


Status:  With -O0 it will run kickstart1.2 and play A500 68k demo's
         sound is glitchy ( obviously without optimization )
         no real input control, defaults to reading misc/uae/uaerc and misc/uae/roms/df0.adf
         With -O2 it may barf, something getting corrupt.
